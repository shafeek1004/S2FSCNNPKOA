**S2FSCNNPKOA: EEG-Based Emotion Recognition using Spatial-Frequency Self-Convolutional Neural Networks Optimized with PKOA**

**Overview**
This repository contains the complete implementation of the paper:

**"Spherical Spatial-Frequency Self-Convolutional Neural Network (S2FSCNN) Optimised with Pied Kingfisher Optimisation Algorithm (PKOA) for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition."**

_The framework uses:_
DBLSHF (Dual Bilateral Least Squares Hybrid Filtering) for noise reduction
mADCT (Modified Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform) for feature extraction
S2FSCNN for spatial-frequency learning,
PKOA for deep model optimization.

The model is validated using DEAP and SEED EEG datasets, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.7% with improved computational efficiency.
